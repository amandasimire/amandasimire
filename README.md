### Hey there, I'm Amanda Simire 🌸  

<!--
A passionate software developer and creative technologist from Canada 🍁  

🚀 I’m currently building **LocalLoop** – a hyperlocal marketplace and community hub powered by cloud tools like Firebase, Supabase, Mapbox, and AWS ☁️  
🧠 I’m diving deeper into **JavaScript, React Native, Node.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and SQL** to level up my full-stack skills  
💬 Let’s talk about **Technology, Health Tech**, or anything you're curious about – I love sharing ideas! 💡  
🤝 I’m open to collaborating on cool projects, hackathons, or community-based tools  
🧶 Fun fact, I love to crochet – yarn and yarn.dev are both my hobbies 😄
